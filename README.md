That's over 3.5 Gigabytes of packages ontop of the base Fedora install, and growing!

## Why Fedora?
Fedora is a stable distribution built by avid performance and security experts. It is known for its robust security features, frequent updates, and strong community support, making it an excellent choice for both desktop and server environments.
Additionally, Fedora is owned and managed by IBM - which means that it's one of the few distrobutions of linux left that's both being overseen and developed by an American company.

## Installation Steps

Then, run the following commands:
```
